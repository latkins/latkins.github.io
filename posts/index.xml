      <description>There are a few versions of attention that have been proposed, but this post will consider the version discussed in Attention Is All You Need, and the subsequent transformer papers (e.g. BERT, GPT, GPT2, etc). This post will only discuss attention, rather than the full transformer architecture.
Attention, as used in transformer models, is often known as self-attention, or intra-attention, and is used to combine a sequence of vectors into a single vector.</description>
